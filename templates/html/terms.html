        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
            By accessing this website, you acknowledge that this is a personal, automated
            status page operated by a single individual. The content displayed is generated
            automatically by the Continuity Orchestrator system.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Nature of the Service</h2>
        <p>
            Continuity Orchestrator is an open-source automation tool that monitors operator
            check-ins and publishes status updates. This site serves as the public-facing
            status dashboard for one specific deployment.
        </p>
        <p>Key characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The site is <strong>read-only</strong> — visitors cannot create accounts, post content, or interact with the system</li>
            <li>Content is <strong>automatically generated</strong> by scheduled workflows</li>
            <li>Status information reflects the current operational state of the system</li>
            <li>Some content may only become visible at certain escalation stages</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
            The Continuity Orchestrator software is open-source. The content published on this
            specific deployment (articles, statements, media) is the intellectual property of
            the operator unless otherwise stated.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Automated Notifications</h2>
        <p>
            The system may post automated status updates to external platforms (email, SMS,
            X/Twitter, Reddit) as part of its escalation pipeline. These automated posts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Are clearly identified as automated</li>
            <li>Are posted from the operator's own accounts</li>
            <li>Contain only status information relevant to the operator's continuity</li>
            <li>Do not interact with or collect data from other users on those platforms</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
            The information provided on this site is for informational purposes only. The
            operator makes no warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness
            of the automatically generated content. The system operates autonomously once
            configured and may not always reflect real-time conditions.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
            The operator shall not be liable for any damages arising from the use of this
            site or the information contained herein. This includes but is not limited to
            damages resulting from system malfunctions, delayed notifications, or inaccurate
            status reporting.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Platforms</h2>
        <p>
            When the system posts notifications to external platforms (X/Twitter, Reddit, etc.),
            those posts are subject to the respective platform's terms of service. The operator
            complies with all applicable platform policies and API terms.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>
            These terms may be updated from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top
            of this page indicates when the most recent changes were made.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Contact</h2>
