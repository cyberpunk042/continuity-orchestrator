## 1. What is Continuity Orchestrator?

Continuity Orchestrator is an **open-source, self-hosted personal safety and accountability tool**. It works like a programmable continuity plan: the operator checks in on a schedule, and if they fail to do so, the system escalates through configured notification channels — email, SMS, social media — to alert designated contacts or make information available.

### Real-world use cases:

**Safety / Solo travel:**
> "I was gone hiking for X days and have not been able to check in. I am possibly in danger. Please contact me if you are worried about me."

**Journalism / Research:**
> "I was recently reporting about ABC, and I have not been able to check in. I am possibly in danger. Details about the situation will be available in 24 hours."

And then, if the escalation continues:
> "I was recently investigating ABC. Per my failure to check in, here is what I had gathered so far, available at: https://cyberpunk042.github.io/continuity-orchestrator/"

**The Reddit integration is one of several optional notification channels.** It allows posting automated status updates to the operator's **own subreddit** as part of this escalation pipeline.

**This is a non-commercial, personal-use project.** It is not a scraper, data harvester, or content aggregator. The complete source code is available for review.

## 2. Intended Reddit API Usage

### What the app does on Reddit:
- **Posts text-only self-posts** to the operator's own subreddit or user profile
- Posts are **automated status updates** triggered by missed check-ins
- All posts are clearly marked as automated (see Bot Identification, §5)

### What the app does NOT do:
- ❌ Does not read, scrape, or collect any Reddit content
- ❌ Does not interact with other users' posts or comments
- ❌ Does not vote, follow, or engage with other accounts
- ❌ Does not access any subreddit other than the operator's own
- ❌ Does not collect, store, or process any Reddit user data
- ❌ Does not use Reddit data for AI/ML training or any model
- ❌ Does not operate commercially or generate revenue
- ❌ Does not serve third-party users — single operator only

### API Endpoints Used:
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/v1/access_token` | POST | OAuth2 token refresh (script app flow) |
| `/api/submit` | POST | Submit a self-post to operator's subreddit |
| `/api/v1/me` | GET | Credential verification (setup/testing only) |

**No other endpoints are used.** The app is write-only — it never reads Reddit content.

---

## 3. App Type & Authentication

- **App Type**: `script` (personal use, single-user)
- **OAuth2 Flow**: `password` grant (script app — operator authenticates as themselves)
- **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:8080` (not used in script flow, but required by Reddit)
- **Single User**: The app only ever authenticates as the one operator who deployed it. It cannot and does not act on behalf of any other Reddit user.

---

## 4. Expected Volume & Rate Limits

This is an extremely low-volume application:

| Metric | Expected Usage |
|--------|---------------|
| Posts per day | 0–3 (only during active escalation) |
| Posts per month | 0–10 typical |
| API calls per minute | < 1 (well below the 100 QPM limit) |
| Peak burst | 2 requests (token refresh + post) |
| Concurrent users | 1 (single operator) |
| Data read from Reddit | None — write-only |

The application implements:
- **Exponential backoff** on HTTP 429 responses
- **Descriptive User-Agent header** per Reddit API guidelines
- **Minimum 2-second delay** between any API calls
- **No polling or scraping** — only outbound posts triggered by escalation events

---

## 5. Bot Identification & Transparency

All automated posts include:
- `[Automated]` prefix in the post title
- A footer identifying the post as system-generated
- A link to the project's public status page

The Reddit account profile will clearly state:
> "This account is used for automated status notifications from the Continuity Orchestrator system. Posts are generated by software, not written manually."

**User-Agent header**: `python:continuity-orchestrator:v1.0 (by /u/SpecialZestyclose255)`

---

## 6. Responsible Builder Policy Compliance

| Policy Requirement | How We Comply |
|-------------------|---------------|
| **Transparency** | Open-source code; bot clearly identified; posts labeled as automated |
| **No data collection** | Write-only — we POST status updates and never read Reddit content |
| **No commercial use** | Personal project with no revenue, ads, or monetization |
| **Respect rate limits** | < 1 QPM average; exponential backoff; 2s minimum between calls |
| **No AI/ML training** | No Reddit data is accessed, stored, or used for any ML purpose |
| **User consent** | Single-user script app; no third-party access or delegation |
| **No circumvention** | No workarounds for limits, bans, or platform restrictions |
| **Descriptive User-Agent** | Set per Reddit API guidelines with app name and maintainer |
| **Accurate use case** | All details in this document are accurate and verifiable in the source code |

```

The Reddit adapter is triggered **only** during escalation events (missed check-ins). Most deployments will see fewer than 10 Reddit posts per month. Many months will see zero.

## 11. Summary

I'm requesting access to create a **script-type app** for personal, non-commercial use.

The application:
- Posts infrequent, clearly-labeled automated status updates to **my own subreddit**
- Uses only 3 API endpoints (`access_token`, `submit`, `me`)
- Never reads, scrapes, or interacts with any Reddit content
- Is open-source, with the complete source code available for review
- Complies fully with the Responsible Builder Policy, Developer Terms, and Data API Terms
- Maintains a professional public presence with Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, and Contact information

Thank you for reviewing this request.
